# User Input Project (React)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project, I made a user login with the main structure elements of React, which I learned and applied before.
You can enter the username and age and list it at the bottom. However, if he saves without entering anything and enters an incorrect age, the user will be warned.
You can exit this warning both by backdroping and pressing the button.
In this project, I learned how to develop a React project by repeating the use of components.
